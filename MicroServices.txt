Use Case
--------
Develop a webapplication to perform Currency Conversion based Currency Exchange Cost

Ex: Dollar to Rupee  | Euro to Rupee  vice versa

This application should support for both C 2 B and B 2 B operations.


Components
----------
UI (presentation)-- TheamLeaf
Controller (To handle C 2 B request)
RestController (To handle B 2 B request)
Service (To execute core Business Logic)
Repository (To execute Persistent Logic)
In Memory DB (To store Currency Exchange Cost)

Application Deployment
---------------------
If application is deployed to single server we have both advantages and dis-advantages.

Advantages
----------
-> Infra Cost is less
-> No need to recruite multiple people to mange deployment process

Dis-Advantages
--------------
-> If requests are more, response time is going to increase

-> There is a chance server may crash

-> If server is crashed, application will be then revenue will be impacted.

-> We can't go for prod deployment without bringing down the application.

-> Prodiving Project Details to new team member is difficult


Load Balancer
-------------
Instead of deploying our application to single server, we will deploy our application to mutliple servers using Load Balancer.

Load Balancer is used to distribute client requests to all the nodes which are connected to cluster.

Advantages
----------
-> Burden on server will be reduced bcz multiple servers will process
-> Response time will be decreased
-> Less Chances for server crash
-> We can scale our application for all scenarios (Big Day sales)
-> We can do production deployments without application down time.

Dis-Advantages
--------------
-> Cluster is a costly solution
-> Lot of money we shud spend to create Infrastructure
-> We need team of admins to setup, maintain and monitor Cluster
-> Resource cost will be high

To resolve problems of Monolithic We are going to use MicroServices



Micro Services
--------------
-> Micro Service is not a Framework
-> Micro Service is not a Technology
-> Micro Service is not an API

-> MicroService is an architectural Design Pattern.

-> The main aim of MicroService is to resolve the problems of       Monolithic Architecture.

-> MicroService is not specific to any programming language. It is an universal Design Pattern to develop applications.


MicroServices Advantages
------------------------
1) New Technologies
2) Parallel Development
3) Fast Releases
4) Dynamic Scaling ( Horizontal Scaling & Vertical Scaling )
5) Explaing Project to new Team members is easy (Single Business Unit)


MicroServices Dis-Advantages
----------------------------
1) Bounded Context (Designing)
2) Lot of Configuration
3) Visibility
4) Pack of cards problem




MicroServices Architecture
--------------------------
MicroServices architecture will talk about how many components will involved and how those components will be connected.

Note: All projects may not follow same architecture. MicroServices architecture will change from project to project.


Currency-Exchange-Service
--------------------------
This MicroService is responsible to provide Currency Exchange Cost.

Who ever want to do Currency Conversion they should get currency exchagne cost using this micro service.

Note: In this Currency Exchange Service, current exchange cost will be available in in-memory database.

Components
----------
CurrencyExchangeRestController.java
CurrencyExchangeService.java
CurrencyExchangeCostBean.java
CurrencyExchangeEntity.java
CurrencyExchangeRepository.java

schema.sql
data.sql

Currency-Conversion-Api
-----------------------
This api is responsible to perform Currency Conversion according to given values.

From : 

To : 

Quantity : 

To perform Currency Conversion it needs Currency Exchange Cost.

Currency Exchange Cost will be provided by Currency-Exchange service

Note: 
-----
Currency-conversion-api will communicate with currency-exchange api

Components
----------
CurrencyConversionRestController.java
CurrencyConversionService.java
CurrencyExchangeCostBean.java--- CE reponse bean
CurrencyBean.java -- CC response bean


http://localhost:2222/convert/from/USD/to/INR/quantity/300










Cloud Platform
--------------
AWS (Amazon Webservices) -- Free Trial (5 GB)

PCF (Pivotal Cloud Foundry) -- $87

Microsoft Azure--



PCF CLI Commands
----------------
cf login

cf target

cf push ---> It requires appname

cf push app-name  --> Unable to recognize build pack

Ex : cf push SBRestApi -p target/jarfilename.jar

cf map-route APP_NAME  DOMAIN_NAME  -hostname tekleads-api
cf delete APP_NAME

cf logs APP_NAME

cf push  ---> it will search for manifest.yml

Currency Converion UI Application
---------------------------------
This web application is used to provide Currency Conversion Functionality for end users.

Note: This UI application will do currency conversion with the help of CC and CE microservices which are running in PCF.


Components
----------
Create Web application using SpringBoot
Controller class (To display Form and To Handle Form submission)
Form Binding Class( To bind form data to java object)
Service class (To handle business logic - Restcall)
Response Bean Class (To store CC api response data)
View File (jsp - to display form)


CC_REST_ENDPONT =
"http://tekleads-cc-api.cfapps.io/convert/from/{from}/to/{to}/quantity/{quantity}";

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Builder builder = Webclient.builder();
WebClient webClient = builder.build( );

CurrencyResponseBean responseBean = 
	  webClient.get( )
	 .uri(CC_REST_ENDPOINT,1,2,3)
	 .retrieve( )
	 .bodyToMono(CurrencyResponseBean.class)
	 .block( );





Spring MVC Flow
---------------
DispatcherServlet : FrontController
HandlerMapper : mapping between request and request-handler
Controller : Request-Handler (@Controller)
ModelAndView : Model represents data, view represnets UI page
ViewResolver : To locate view files, to understand view technology
View : To render Model Data on View File


Service Registry For MicroServices
----------------------------------
Service Registry is used to maintain project related microservices details.

We can use Netflix-Eureka Server as a Service Registry.

Working with Service Registry
------------------------------
1) Create SpringBoot Web application

2) Add Eureka-Server dependency in pom.xml file

3) Use @EnableEurekaServer at SpringBoot start class

4) ServiceRegistry project should not register with Eureka

	eureka.client.register-with-eureka=false

5) After Running this application, eureka dashboard using below url
		
		localhost:<port-num>



Creating MicroService which acts as Eureka Client
--------------------------------------------------
1) Create SpringBoot Web application

2) Add Eureka-Client dependency in pom.xml file

3) Use @EnableDiscoveryClient at SpringBoot main class

4) Create Required RestControllers, Services etc...

5) Change port number in application.yml file

6) Add Application Name application.yml file (It is vvvvimp)

7) Run application, then check Eureka Dashboard


Note: If Eureka Service Registry Project running in diff machine, then we should add below property in client application yml file.

eureka:
  client:
    service-url:
      defaultZone: http://IP:PORT-NUM/eureka



Creating API Gateway
--------------------
1) Create SpringBoot Web application

2) Add Eureka Client Dependency in pom.xml

3) Add Zuul dependency in pom.xml

4) Use @EnableDiscoveryClient at SpringBoot start class

5) Change port number and configure Application name in yml file

6) Run this application and check Eureka dashboard.

@EnableFeignClients
---------------------------------------------
@FeignClient(name="GREET-SERVICE")
public interface GreetApiClientProxy{

    @RequestMapping("/getGreetMsg/{name}")
    public String invokeGreetApi(@PathVariable("name") String name);
